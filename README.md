# Battleships-TSI

## Running program

1. Install Go [from here](https://go.dev/dl/), selecting the relevant featured download for your system. (Don't need to do this if using the executables)
2. To run the tests use the command `go test`, to run the program, either run the command `go run .` or use the "battleship-tsi-" executable for your system (all compiled for amd64 architecture).
3. If you're using a machine that supports running Makefiles, then you can test and build the program for major OSes using the `make` command, while `make test` will run all of the unit tests
